          <p>
            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Tijani â€” a Software Engineer with a deep curiosity
            for tech and a love for building things that actually make a
            difference. I got into software development out of pure fascination,
            and since then, Iâ€™ve been hooked on bringing ideas to life through
            code. <br />
            Over time, Iâ€™ve grown confident working with a wide range of tools
            and technologies â€” including the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
            React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js), as well as Vue.js,
            Macle SDK, Mini App development, and Appcube. Iâ€™ve built
            full-fledged web and mobile apps that are scalable, efficient, and
            user-friendly from start to finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though I come from a traditional computer engineering
            background, most of what I know today came from rolling up my
            sleeves and learning by doing. From online courses and tutorials to
            real-world projects, Iâ€™ve explored both the front-end and back-end
            sides of development. <br />
            What really drives me is solving problems and turning complex ideas
            into clean, working solutions. I enjoy crafting smooth user
            experiences just as much as I enjoy optimizing the logic behind
            them. For me, tech is all about evolving â€” learning new things,
            taking on challenges, and leveling up with every project I take on.
